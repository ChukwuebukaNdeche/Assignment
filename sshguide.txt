When we set up a repository on github we chose the HTTPS which is the default option.
This time we use SSH or Secure Socket Shell protocol.To do this we take the following steps.
 
STEP1: Check if the key exist locally using the command "ls -al ~/.ssh". This would list down all the ssh keys in your system.

STEP2: Generate the key if it dosen't exist. you can generate the key with the command "ssh-keygen -trsa -C 'your email'"

STEP3: Add the key to your github account. Copy the content of the public key and go to your github, click on your profile
       and then click on settings and select ssh key and paste

STEP4: Start pushing commits freely. When you try pushing commit, it will not ask for username and password like it use to.
